# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here. The format is
based on Keep a Changelog, and the project adheres to Semantic Versioning
(the package and the dataset are versioned independently — see
`docs/Compatibility.md`).

  metrics, sealed run artifacts), `peira` CLI (`run`/`validate`/`report`),
  deterministic mock adapter, 12-case offline demo fixture.
- Rust workspace with `peira-core` skeleton (ports hot paths after the
  Phase 0 interface freeze).
- Docs: Methodology, Taxonomy, Threat-Model, Severity-Rubric, Concepts,
  FAQ, Troubleshooting, Glossary, Hardware, Compatibility, Contributing,
  Claims, Decisions.
- CI: Python + Rust tests, `public-surface` strategy-language check, README
  quickstart executed verbatim on Ubuntu/macOS/Windows.
